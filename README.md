# multiplayer-js
Working towards a full game to release, this is a base model
all coded in js, using node, express, and socket.io. Future additions
would be to add in user interpolation as well as a stylesheet and sprites
to use in game for the map and characters.

# How to run
This repository contains all files needed to run this game, so just clone
the repository, and with node installed, while in this game's directory, run
node bot.js, and it will be ported to your localhost:2000.

# Note
All code, other than those generated by npm and its packages, is my own
